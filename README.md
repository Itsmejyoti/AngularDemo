## Clone your own Version
If you want to clone your own version of this app to play around with and extend, here's the steps to follow:

1. Sign-in to Aerobatic at https://aerobaticapp.com/auth/github
2. Click the `Create New App` button
3. Create a name for your app, something other than "sfcontacts"
4. Rather than clone the aerobatic-starter app, clone this repo.
```
git clone
```
5. Run `npm install & bower install`
